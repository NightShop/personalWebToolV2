Site I made for myself for personal development. Data is stored with Firestore and authentication is set with Firebase AUTH. Each account has acces to his documents. Blog is visible to all but can be edited only from admin account directly from site. I used React, Webpack, Tailwind. It's mobile friendly. All tehniques are based on "science" from books Atomic Habits, The Power of Habit and blog gettingstronger.org. On Tools section I tried to mimick brutalist styled websites.

Site is live on Firebase: https://optimized-b2358.web.app
